Predict Molecular Energy, XGB, LGBM, Random Forest, and Stacked Generalization

This project is my undergraduate thesis, how machine learning implemented to my field of study in uni (Physics). I using 3 decision tree based algorithm to predict molecular atomization energy, such as XGBoost, LightGBM and Random Forest. Then, tried 1 ensemble method to compare with 3 model previusly, it is Stacked Generalization who combined XGB and LigthGBM, and using Ridge Regression as meta-learner.
